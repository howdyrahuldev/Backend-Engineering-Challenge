# Microservices-based E-commerce System

## Introduction
This repository contains a microservices-based system for managing a simple e-commerce application. The system handles user authentication, product management, and order processing. This README provides an overview of the system architecture, setup instructions, and other relevant information.

## Microservices Architecture
The system consists of the following microservices:

1. **User Authentication Service:** Responsible for user registration, authentication, and authorization.
2. **Product Management Service:** Manages CRUD operations for products.
3. **Order Processing Service:** Handles order creation, retrieval, and management.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Flask (for building microservices)
- PostgreSQL (as the database)
- Docker (for containerization)
- Kubernetes (for orchestration)

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/howdyrahuldev/Backend-Engineering-Challenge-PESTO.git

2. Set up the database:
   - Install PostgreSQL and create a database for the system.
   - Update database configuration in each microservice's code.

3. Build and run each microservice.

## API Endpoints
- **User Authentication Service:**
  - `POST /register`: Register a new user.
  - `POST /login`: Authenticate a user.

- **Product Management Service:**
  - `GET /products`: Retrieve all products.
  - `POST /products`: Create a new product.

- **Order Processing Service:**
  - `GET /orders`: Retrieve all orders.
  - `POST /orders`: Create a new order.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the microservices can communicate with each other and the database.
- Implement error handling, logging, and testing for each microservice.
- Consider deploying the microservices on a cloud platform for scalability and high availability.
